This activity looks to give an introductory experience to precision agriculture using computer vision techniques.



Objectives:
- Understand basic pipeline of training deep learning models.
- Understand difficulties present in agricultural environments.

# Dataset

In this occasion we are gonna use the dataset Cherry CO that contains detection and segmentation labels of cherries in agricultural environments:
